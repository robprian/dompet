## [v0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-31

🎉 Initial Community Release — Poka CE has officially entered the Beta phase.

All core features are feature-complete and ready to be explored:

- **Transactions** — income, expense, and transfer tracking with split transaction support (header + item detail), real-time balance mutation, and hard-delete with reversal.
- **Budgets** — spending limits with monthly/weekly/yearly/custom periods and accurate progress deduction from transaction items.
- **Goals** — saving targets backed by auto-generated Goal pockets with transfer-based deposits.
- **Debts & Loans** — inter-personal cash flows with paired income/expense transactions and remaining balance tracking.
- **Recurring Transactions** — automatic bills that generate real transactions and shift their next date on app startup.
- **Accounts & Pockets** — parent accounts with sub-wallets and category restrictions.
- **Categories** — income/expense categories with sub-categories.
- **Dashboard, Reports, Settings, Onboarding & Backup** supporting the core experience.

> **⚠️ Important Note:** This version is still under testing. Deep edge cases (such as editing or deleting complex interconnected data) have not been fully verified. Unexpected bugs may occur — we recommend trying it with dummy data first, or regularly backing up your data from the Settings menu.
